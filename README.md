This App is intended to perform a quick analysis of your WhatsApp chats as easy as possible: reading your chat history and summarizing keys information.
For that, follow theses steps: 

1. `Export` the chat you desire to analyse from WhatsApp (See screenshots below )
2. `Upload` the chat file into App using Browse... button in left sidebar menus
3. `Enjoy` the App by switching between menus in sidebar.
